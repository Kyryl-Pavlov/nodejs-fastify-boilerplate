# nodejs-fastify-boilerplate

A production-ready **Node.js / TypeScript / Fastify** boilerplate for building scalable **REST** and **GraphQL** APIs — engineered for teams who want a clean architecture without spending weeks on infrastructure.

Ships fully wired: **JWT authentication**, **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM and migrations, **AWS S3** file uploads with presigned URLs, async event processing via **AWS SQS + Lambda**, **Redis** caching, **Nginx** reverse proxy with DDoS protection, structured logging to **Sentry / CloudWatch / Loki**, **Prometheus** metrics with **Grafana** dashboards, **Docker Compose** full-stack setup, and a **Vitest** test suite (unit · integration · E2E) — all production-wired from the first commit.

This wiki is the reference documentation for the project. The [README](https://github.com/Kyryl-Pavlov/nodejs-fastify-boilerplate#readme) is the quick-start entry point; this wiki goes deeper on architecture, operations, and infrastructure.

## At a glance

- REST API at `/api/v1/` (Fastify plugins) and GraphQL at `/graphql` (Mercurius, SDL-first) — same Prisma models and service layer underneath, only the transport differs.
- Full local stack via `docker compose up --build`: Postgres, LocalStack (S3 + SQS), Redis, Nginx, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana, pgAdmin, S3 console.
- Migrations run automatically on every `docker compose up --build` via the one-shot `migrate` service.
- Two GitHub Actions deploy workflows (`deploy-dev.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`) target AWS ECS Fargate + Lambda, provisioned by the `terraform/` module tree.
